{'Project Title: read me file\n\nProject Description:  lots of description\n\nInstallation Instructions: instructions to install it\n\nUsage Instructions: Sulfites occur naturally in all wines to some extent.[6][7][8] Sulfites are commonly introduced to arrest fermentation at a desired time, and may also be added to wine as preservatives to prevent spoilage and oxidation at several stages of the winemaking. Sulfur dioxide (SO2) protects wine not only from oxidation, but also from bacteria.[9]\n\nOrganic wines are not necessarily sulfite-free, but generally have lower amounts and regulations stipulate lower maximum sulfite contents for these wines. In general, white wines contain more sulfites than red wines and sweeter wines contain more sulfites than drier ones.[10]\n\nIn the United States, wines bottled after mid-1987 must have a label stating that they contain sulfites if they contain more than 10 parts per million (ppm).[11] In the European Union an equivalent regulation came into force in November 2005.[12] This includes sulfur dioxide, and the limit is on the milligrams per kilogram or per litre of sulfur dioxide equivalent.[3] In 2012, a new regulation for organic wines came into force.[13] In the United Kingdom, similar laws apply. Bottles of wine that contain over 10 mg/L (ppm) of "sulfites" (or sulfur dioxide) are required to bear "contains sulphites" on the label.[14] This does not differ if sulfites are naturally occurring or added in the winemaking process.[15]\n'}
